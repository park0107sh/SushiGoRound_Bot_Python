# SushiGoRound_Bot_Python
SushiGoRound MiniClip Game Bot using Image reading

This bot program runs strictly according to one's screen. All the global variables (x_pad, y_pad) have been declared up top. 
One needs to change them to fit their screen size in order for bot to move mouse correctly.
This is pre-project for Poker playing bot project I am currently working on.
Thanks for the instructions and enlightenments to Chris Kiehl, an editor for an Atlanta based media company.
